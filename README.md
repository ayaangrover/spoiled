Spoiled is a 2D platformer about being left behind.  When a mass migration separates you from your friends and family, you’re trapped in the icy world they abandoned for its lack of food. You may have been left behind, but you know that far ahead lies the green world: a place of life, color, and family. Armed with nothing but instinct, you’ll clamber over old boxes, dodge deadly spikes, and navigate the wreckage of a world you used to call home.
