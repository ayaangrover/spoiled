Spoiled is a game I'm currently making in Godot. It's my first game in Godot and I'm following [this series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5msTt9Jeyg) and it's very helpful. So far, I haven't made much original content. However, my plan is to make a game where there's a spoiled king who just dumps all the spoiled(double meaning!) food into the ocean, which is raising the sea level. You have to climb to where he is and stop him before he floods the cities!

You can try and play it if you'd like, but its a WIP so far.
